<auto> <strong>Danny Barnes</strong>is 12 years old and plays Bass guitar for Meltdown Cinema (MC). Danny started as a piano player at the Piano Cottage when he was 5. After several years of piano, he decided to make a switch to Bass, an instrument he has grown to love. Danny has appeared as a member of the past 2 Piano Cottage Rocks! concerts, providing Bass support on numerous songs. MC is his ﬁrst experience in a band and he has loved the experience of making new friends with his bandmates and learning the process of rehearsing, collaborating and putting on a show. When not jamming with Meltdown, he enjoys playing soccer, basketball and listening to and learning rock music like The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Steely Dan. His dream is to one day get a Rickenbacker bass—-but for now, he loves his red Fender!
